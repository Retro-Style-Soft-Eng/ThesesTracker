# ThesesTracker

We are now using CRA for our react application.

To start the web application, do in your favorite terminal:<br>
'git clone git@github.com:Retro-Style-Soft-Eng/ThesesTracker.git'
'cd thesis-app'<br>
'npm start'

Ignore the vulnerabilities in 'npm' for the timebeing, they may break the app.

Don't forget to commit to 'main' specifically, not 'master'.
