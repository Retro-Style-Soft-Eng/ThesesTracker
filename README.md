# ThesesTracker

We are now using CRA for our react application.

To start the web application, do in your favorite terminal:<br>
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Retro-Style-Soft-Eng/ThesesTracker.git
cd thesis-app
npm start
```

Make sure your account SSH key is set up to be able to use git push/pull.

Ignore the vulnerabilities in `npm` for the timebeing, they may break the app.
